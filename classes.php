                the balance of the Pancha Mahabhutas: earth, water, fire, air
                and space – that are the source of all life. Students will also
                be fluent in the Abhyasa sequence designed by Yogacharya Bharath
                Shetty. By the end of the PRITHVI classes, students would
                have built the strength and flexibility to attempt headstands,
                backbends, and other challenging postures.
