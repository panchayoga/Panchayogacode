             <p>By integrating the disciplines of Hatha & Ashtanga Yoga, we design <b><i>holistic sequences that connect you to the five elements</i></b> of earth, water, fire, air and space that exist within each one of us.</p>
             <p>Hatha Yoga with its static, powerful postures and Ashtanga with its dynamic flows help you <b><i>achieve inner alignment and tap into your full potential</i></b>. With the perfect balance of theory and practice, students achieve a robust understanding of yoga asanas and progress peacefully towards their goals. From core-strengthening sequences to playful drills, every class has something different to offer — and no two sessions ever feel the same.</p>
           <p>Students can choose to enroll in a regular class – or a combination of a class and a workshop to maximize their experience. Remember: no matter how hard it gets — the number one rule is to have fun and enjoy every step of the process.</p>
