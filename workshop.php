            <p>Deepen your practice and transition into advanced asanas</p>
            <p>Be part of a growing community of yoga practitioners who’re peacefully progressing towards their goals and inspiring others in the process. This isn’t just a test of physical strength; it’s a masterclass in mental resilience, focus and mindfulness. In this weekly 90-minute session, we <strong><i>play with different poses to expand the realm of possibility and ease our way into advanced asanas</i></strong>. Each class focuses on warming you up and preparing your body for a specific pose, so you can attempt it with clarity and confidence. From headstands and arm balances to backbends, inversions and beyond — we have you covered. This class can either serve as a bridge between the Intermediate and Advanced classes OR considered an add-on to advanced classes.</p>

              <p>The extra guidance and support will go a long way in supplementing your practice and taking you to the next level.

            <div class="column" style="background-color:#aaa;">
              <p>In this workshop, <strong><i>we break down complex poses into smaller parts</i></strong> so you can observe the intricacies and integrate the learnings into your own ritual. We will also be revisiting postures from the first three levels to align our mind and body for a deeper and more rigorous session. With equal emphasis on theory and practice, this class empowers you to attempt the forearm balance (Pincha Mayurasana), handstands and other advanced transitions.</p>
